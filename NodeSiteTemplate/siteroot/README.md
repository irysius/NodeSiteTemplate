##Introduction
This is a test project to see if I can utilize TypeScript in order to better manage Node.js projects.

This project is created under the assumption that the IDE you will be using for you development will be Visual Studio 2013.

WebMatrix will perform just as well, although the TypeScript support is a bit lacking at the time of this writing.

This project is built on the following:

* express
* vash

##Basic Commands
(Because I'm forgetful)

To install a new node package, run: **`npm install {package name}`**

To install a new node package and add it to the package.json, run: **`npm install {package name} --save`**

To fetch or update all referenced node packages, run: **`npm update`**

To start the server, run: **`node server`** or **`npm start`**

When the project has tests, run: **`npm test`**
